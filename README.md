### [Tile](tile)
PCB for the actual gaming tile

Note that this layout has been taken over by Jetta. The latest PCBs are [here](hardware/pcb/Jetta-Blinks-PCB.svg). Note that the Jetta layout (1) does not have the `A` pin on the SP connector connected, and (2) swaps the connections for the `R` and `T` pins compared to previous boards. A new SP board with only 3 pins was created to compensate for these pin swaps.    

### [Dev candy board](SP%20board)
PCB that gives access to a serial port and other features useful for developers
